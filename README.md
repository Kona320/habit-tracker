Self-assessment with canvas rubric:

A. Core functionality: The app functions well and has everything it's supposed to have, like you can add habit, tick days, the data persists when the website is refreshed,
it shows current and best streak. (10 points)

B. Code quality: Code is clean and coherent (5 points)

C. UX and accessibility: Website is responsive and works well with any screen size. It has keyboard support, there is validation messages like for example when you click "delete".
There is no jarring shifts and everything works smoothly. The website app has checkmarks for the ticked boxes and little fire icon in front of streaks for little extra motivation. (5 points)

D. Data handling: Has sensible defaults and error handling. Could probably be improved and hardened if it was needed. (3 points) 

E. Documentation: Has install and run steps for windows, but not mac, with good clarity. Documentation has reflection. (2 points)

F. Deployment: Live URL and github page. (2 points)

G. Demo video: Work in progress. (? points)

Reflection:

What I learned and what I could improve next? Well basically I have learned the basic idea of how a web app works and how it can be made. It is interesting to see, because I have made one website
before, but it was only with html and css. Now I got to add javascript in to the mix and it is cool to see what it can do. As the name says, it can be used to make apps on web and you can run it like
normal website with live url or you could just use it locally if you wanted to. For example if you wanted to make app like habit tracker just for yourself, you wouldn't really have to deploy it, but you could
just use it locally from your PC / laptop. And what can I improve? Well I can learn lot more. This is only the beginning. I do like the idea of making apps with JS.
